 Today, making websites and apps look great and work smoothly is crucial as users want fast, responsive, and visually pleasing experiences. This is where Swirl UI comes in. It's a collection of re-usable animated UI components built using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, that you can copy and paste into your apps, helping developers create amazing user experiences quickly and easily.

## Why animations matter?

Animations are important in modern UI design. They make user experiences better by providing visual feedback, guiding users, and making interactions more engaging. Smooth animations can turn a simple interface into an enjoyable experience, keeping users interested and satisfied. They help users understand the flow of an application, highlight important elements, and provide a sense of continuity and responsiveness.
